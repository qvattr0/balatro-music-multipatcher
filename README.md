# Balatro Music Patcher

A simple program for patching custom music into Balatro.
(Specifically Dom Palombi's covers.)

On Windows this program uses 7zip to replace in-game files with the custom music.
If 7zip is not installed, the program will download it for you, but it is
recommended to install it yourself. [here](https://www.7-zip.org/)

### Partial Music Packs
The program also allows you to replace parts of the soundtrack instead of all
the files. Just put in the specific music files you'd like to have replaced in
the dedicated music pack folder, and you're good to go!
